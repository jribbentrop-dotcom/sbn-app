# Code & Security Audit — Soul Bossa Nova

**Date:** 2026-07-09 (updated 2026-07-09)
**Scope:** Code & architecture, security & config (Laravel 13 / PHP 8.3, Vue + Inertia)
**Method:** Static review of routes, controllers, services, middleware, models, config, and repo state. The PHPUnit suite was **not** executed (no PHP runtime in the audit sandbox); test observations come from the result cache and file inventory.

**Status legend:** ✅ Fixed · ⬜ Open (for follow-up)

## Summary

| # | Finding | Area | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `api/admin/*` gated by `auth` only — missing `instructor` | Security | **High** | ✅ Fixed |
| 2 | Dead `routes/admin.php` with `auth`-only admin CRUD | Security | Medium | ✅ Fixed |
| 3 | `APP_DEBUG=true` in `.env` — confirm production is `false` | Config | Low | ⬜ Open (verify prod) |
| 4 | `.env.example` missing config keys | Config | Low | ✅ Fixed |
| 5 | God controller: `LeadsheetController` (4,728 lines / 80 methods) | Architecture | Medium | ⬜ Open |
| 6 | Harmonic scorer duplicated across two services | Architecture | Medium | ✅ Fixed |
| 7 | Thin request validation (only 3 FormRequests) | Code quality | Medium | 🟡 Partial |
| 8 | `UserProfile` uses `$guarded = []` (open mass assignment) | Code quality | Low | ✅ Fixed |
| 9 | Tracked/stray files that should be ignored or removed | Repo hygiene | Low | ⬜ Open |
| 10 | Test suite state unverified; leftover `console.log`/TODOs | Code quality | Low | 🟡 Partial |

**What's already solid:** `.env` and `sbn.db` are correctly untracked; the Stripe webhook verifies its signature and is idempotent; the CSRF exception is narrowly scoped to the webhook route; the beta auth gate (`redirectGuestsTo → register`) is coherent.

## Security

### 1. Broken access control on `api/admin/*` — **High** — ✅ Fixed 2026-07-09

> **Resolved:** `routes/web.php:274` now uses `Route::middleware(['auth', 'instructor'])`. The `instructor` alias is registered in `bootstrap/app.php:19`. All admin JSON endpoints now reject non-instructor accounts.

`routes/web.php:274` opens the entire admin JSON API with `auth` middleware only, omitting the `instructor` guard that its sibling `/admin` web group carries (`routes/web.php:122`). The controllers perform **no internal authorization** — e.g. `LeadsheetController::destroy()` deletes immediately with no role check.

**Impact:** any authenticated (free) account that knows the URLs can:

- `DELETE /api/admin/leadsheets/{id}` and `DELETE /api/admin/exercises/{id}` — destroy content
- `POST /api/admin/leadsheets/{id}/is-pro` and `.../status` — flip `is_pro`/publish state. Per project rules this drives monetization **and** can expose copyrighted songs through the pro Viewer/Cinema path.
- Invoke `redetect`, `transcribe-stem`, `youtube/search`, `reprocess-progressions` — expensive operations that incur YouTube-API and transcription cost and enable denial-of-service.

This is a classic broken-access-control gap (OWASP A01). Client-side UI hiding does not protect the endpoints.

**Fix:** add the role guard to the group:

```php
// routes/web.php:274
Route::middleware(['auth', 'instructor'])->prefix('api/admin')->name('api.admin.')->group(function () {
```

Then confirm no legitimate non-instructor caller depends on these routes (they shouldn't). Consider adding `authorize()`/policy checks in the controllers as defense in depth.

### 2. Dead `routes/admin.php` — Medium — ✅ Fixed 2026-07-09

> **Resolved:** file deleted. Confirmed it was never loaded (`bootstrap/app.php` registers only `web.php`, `console.php`, `channels.php`) and referenced nowhere, so removal has no functional impact.

`routes/admin.php` defined admin rhythm CRUD behind `auth` only (no `instructor`), but the file was **never loaded**. It was misleading and repeated the mistake in #1 if anyone wired it in.

### 3. Debug flag — Low — ⬜ Open (checked 2026-07-13, still needs live verification)

`.env` has `APP_ENV=local` and `APP_DEBUG=true`. Correct for local work, but if the production `.env` inherits `APP_DEBUG=true`, stack traces and environment details leak on errors.

`deploy/env-production.txt` (the reference template for the production `.env`) correctly declares `APP_ENV=production` / `APP_DEBUG=false`, and nothing in `deploy/` overwrites it with a different value. That's good evidence of intent, but this repo has no automated deploy step that applies the template and no SSH access to the live server, so the *actual* file on production has not been directly confirmed. Someone with server access should run `grep APP_DEBUG /path/to/.env` on the production host to close this out.

### 4. `.env.example` drift — Low — ✅ Fixed 2026-07-09

> **Resolved:** added the Reverb broadcasting block (`REVERB_*` + `VITE_REVERB_*`) and the missing LLM/API keys (`DEEPSEEK_*`, `GROQ_*`, `COHERE_API_KEY`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`). Stripe/`PAYMENTS_PROVIDER` were already present as intentional production-only comments; `DB_*` remain commented for the default SQLite setup.

Several keys the application reads were absent from `.env.example`, so a fresh deploy or new developer would boot with silently missing config.

## Code & architecture

### 5. God controller — `Admin/LeadsheetController.php` — Medium

4,728 lines and 80 methods spanning CRUD, audio transcription, progression detection, YouTube search, and voicing identification. It is the largest maintainability liability in the codebase and concentrates the blast radius of #1.

> **Scoped but deliberately deferred (2026-07-13):** mapped the full method inventory (44 public methods, ~1,700-line transcription cluster, natural CRUD/Transcription/Voicing/Progression seams) before starting. The split is real work, not mechanical: `createFromLookup` (~380 lines) is simultaneously a CRUD-create action and a full audio-transcription pipeline, and three helpers (`normalizeChordNamesInJson`, the `serializeLeadsheet`/`backfillFingersFromCrossref` pair, and the injected `LeadsheetParser`) cross every proposed cluster boundary. Attempting this blind with no way to run the test suite in-session (no `vendor/` installed here) was judged too risky — deferred for a session with local test execution. Two cheap, low-risk pieces are worth doing first whenever this is picked up: (1) move the two orphan methods `youtubeSearch` and `resolveNumerals` out (neither shares a helper with anything, and `resolveNumerals`'s route is already named `progressions.resolveNumerals`, not `leadsheets.*`); (2) extract the self-contained ~900-line MIDI/tab/beat-grid algorithm cluster (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/LeadsheetController.php:3463-4724` — `assembleTranscription`, `optimizeTabPositions`, `bassSnapBeatTimes`, etc.) into its own service, since it has zero constructor-dependency ties to the controller and no route changes are needed.

**Fix:** split by responsibility — e.g. `LeadsheetCrudController`, `LeadsheetTranscriptionController`, `LeadsheetVoicingController` — pushing logic into services. Related oversized files worth decomposing: `ProgressionBuilder.php` (4,369), `VoicingCrossref.php` (3,335), `resources/js/tab-editor/TabEditor.vue` (3,547).

### 6. Duplicated harmonic scorer — Medium — ✅ Fixed 2026-07-13

> **Resolved, and smaller than it first looked.** Investigating the three `TODO(harmonic-scorer)` notes (`ProgressionBuilder.php:1628,1694,1729`) found: (a) no actual "scorer" — `ProgressionBuilder` has no equivalent of `ProgressionDetector::resolveFamily()`/`tokenScore()`; that part of the finding (and `docs/SBN-Builder-Reference.md`'s note on a future `HarmonicScorer`) was aspirational, not a description of present duplication; (b) `ProgressionBuilder::qualityToSuffix()`, the method whose name most directly claims to duplicate `ProgressionDetector::qualityToSuffix()`, had **zero call sites** — dead code; (c) the two `normalizeQuality*` methods, while both flagged as duplicates, actually solve different problems (Builder wants near-exact quality preserved for chord-name display; Detector deliberately collapses extensions to base harmonic function for pattern matching) and would break one caller if forced into a single shared implementation.
>
> Extracted `app/Services/Harmony/ChordQualityMapper.php` as the single source of truth for both real (non-dead) use cases, keeping them as two distinct named methods rather than one incorrectly-merged `normalize()`: `normalizeAlias()`/`toChordNameSuffix()` (the display path, ex-`ProgressionBuilder`) and `normalizeForFunction()`/`toRomanSuffix()` (the functional path, ex-`ProgressionDetector`). Both classes now take an optional `ChordQualityMapper` constructor param (defaults to `new ChordQualityMapper()`, so no existing call site — including the two places tests construct these classes directly with `new` — needed to change) and delegate to it instead of keeping private copies. The dead `ProgressionBuilder::qualityToSuffix()` was deleted outright rather than preserved as a delegate. Pure move + delegate, no behavior changes beyond removing the dead method. Added `tests/Unit/ChordQualityMapperTest.php` (no DB dependency) to lock in both paths' behavior, including a test that deliberately documents where they diverge (`maj6`: display keeps "6", functional collapses to "maj7").

`ProgressionBuilder` duplicated `qualityToSuffix` and (per the original finding's phrasing) "scorer logic" from `ProgressionDetector`, flagged by three in-code `TODO(harmonic-scorer)` notes. Divergence meant the detector and the builder could silently disagree on the same harmony.

### 7. Thin request validation — Medium — 🟡 Partially fixed 2026-07-13

> **Partial:** the three endpoints named in this finding (`updateIsPro`, `updateStatus`, `uploadBackingTrack` on `Admin/LeadsheetController`) now use dedicated FormRequests — `LeadsheetIsProRequest`, `LeadsheetStatusRequest`, `LeadsheetBackingTrackRequest` (`app/Http/Requests/Admin/`). Each `authorize()`s via `$user->isInstructor()` as defense in depth on top of the route-level `instructor` middleware. `LeadsheetIsProRequest` also closes a real gap found while fixing this: the old `updateIsPro` docblock claimed to "nudge the admin" against enabling `is_pro` on non-`public_domain` rows, but no such check existed in code — an instructor could set `is_pro=true` on a copyrighted song and expose it via the pro Viewer/Cinema path (the exact impact flagged in finding #1). The FormRequest now rejects that combination with a validation error.
>
> The rest of the ~80-method admin write surface (leadsheet CRUD, exercises, chords, progressions, rhythm patterns, etc.) still takes raw `Request` and has not been converted — that remains open, tracked below.

Only 3 `FormRequest` classes existed for a large admin write surface (now 6). Most write endpoints still accept a raw `Request`. This pairs naturally with fixing #1.

**Fix:** introduce FormRequests (with authorization + validation rules) for the remaining admin write endpoints — `AdminExerciseController`, `ChordController`, `ProgressionController`, `ProgressionBuilderController`, and the rest of `LeadsheetController`.

### 8. `UserProfile` mass assignment — Low — ✅ Fixed 2026-07-13

> **Resolved:** `app/Models/UserProfile.php` now uses `protected $fillable = ['display_name', 'bio', 'public']`. Verified against all call sites (`AccountController::updateProfile`/`profile`, `BackfillCustomerBackend`) — none mass-assign beyond those three fields; `avatar_path`/`last_seen_at` are set via direct property assignment and are unaffected.

`app/Models/UserProfile.php` used `protected $guarded = []`, leaving every attribute mass-assignable. 17 of 29 models correctly use `$fillable`.

### 9. Repo hygiene — Low

- Tracked despite now being in `.gitignore` (committed before the rules): `resources/js/tab-editor.zip` (80 KB) and `public/images/mega-menu/featured-collection.png`. Run `git rm --cached` on both.
- Stray uncommitted files to remove or ignore: `# SBN Homepage — Skill Path Section.txt`, `ssr-test-tmp.mjs`, `scripts/probe_665785.php`, `scripts/probe_regress.php`, `database/sbn.db.bak-20260702-precleanup`.
- `ffmpeg.exe` (~100 MB) and `yt-dlp.exe` (~18 MB) sit in the repo root — correctly gitignored, but heavy working-tree clutter; consider relocating outside the project.

### 10. Tests & residue — Low — 🟡 Partial (test coverage added, baseline still not run)

47 test files across Unit/Feature/Integration. The PHPUnit result cache records ~105 non-passing entries against 258 timed tests, and `tests/Unit/IdentifierRegressionCases.php` has uncommitted changes. The suite was not run here (no `vendor/` in this sandbox — `composer install` never ran).

Added `tests/Feature/Admin/LeadsheetAdminRequestsTest.php` and `tests/Feature/Account/UserProfileFillableTest.php` to cover the #7/#8 changes above. Both follow `InstructorGateTest`'s pattern (transaction-wrapped against the real dev DB, rolled back in `tearDown`, never committed) rather than `RefreshDatabase`. Writing `UserProfileFillableTest` caught a real regression in the #8 fix: `firstOrCreate(['user_id' => ...], [...])` mass-assigns via `create()`, and Eloquent's `fillableFromArray()` strips any key not in `$fillable` — including `user_id` — *before* it reaches the model, so the initial `$fillable = ['display_name','bio','public']` (missing `user_id`) would have made every new profile row fail to persist its primary key. `user_id` was added to `$fillable`; safe because no call site ever mass-assigns it from raw request input. **These new tests have not been run** (same `vendor/` gap) — run them first when back on a machine with PHP + composer, they're the most direct regression check for tonight's changes.

**Fix:** run `php artisan test` (or at minimum the two new files above) to establish the current green/red baseline before relying on it. Also: 21 `console.log` calls remain in shipped JS and there are 68 `TODO/FIXME/HACK` markers across `app/` and `resources/js/`.

## Recommended order

Completed in this pass: **#1** (instructor guard), **#2** (deleted dead route file), **#4** (synced `.env.example`), **#6** (extracted shared `ChordQualityMapper`), **#8** (`UserProfile` mass-assignment fix), **#9** (untracked the two stray tracked files).

Partially completed: **#7** (FormRequests + `is_pro`/`public_domain` business-rule fix for the three endpoints the finding named; the rest of the admin write surface is still raw `Request`). **#3** checked — `deploy/env-production.txt` correctly templates `APP_DEBUG=false`, but the live production `.env` itself hasn't been directly inspected (no server access from this environment). **#10** — added `tests/Feature/Admin/LeadsheetAdminRequestsTest.php`, `tests/Feature/Account/UserProfileFillableTest.php`, and `tests/Unit/ChordQualityMapperTest.php` to cover tonight's changes; the full-suite baseline is still not established (no `vendor/` in this sandbox).

Deliberately deferred: **#5** — scoped (see finding #5 above for the method inventory and the two low-risk pieces to start with) but not attempted; the real 4-way split needs a session with local test execution to verify safely.

Remaining follow-up work:

1. **#7** — convert the remaining admin write endpoints (leadsheet CRUD, exercises, chords, progressions, rhythm patterns) to FormRequests.
2. **#3** — someone with production server access should confirm the live `.env` actually has `APP_DEBUG=false`.
3. **#5** — decompose `LeadsheetController`, starting with the two low-risk pieces noted above.
4. **#10** — run `php artisan test` locally to establish the full green/red baseline, including tonight's three new test files.
